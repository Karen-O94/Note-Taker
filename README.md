## Installation
In order to render this app, you will need to run `npm i express` in order to install the 'express' package dependencies as specified in the package.json.

The express package will give you access to a series of methods to `GET` and `POST` information from the API object created from user inputs. 

You will also need to specify a port number. In this app we have used `3000` but you can use any PORT that works well with Node applications. 

Once express is installed, you can initialise the application itself by running `node server.js` in the command line

## Test
There are no test packages on this app. However, you can use Chrome DevTools on your browser or run the server.js file in your command line to ensure there are no errors. 

## Usage

[Note Taker]()

After running `node server.js` within the command line, the `listen` function of the express package will notify you that the server is listening to the port specified. 

The application takes in the user's reponses and populates the input fields of the its corresponding HTML element.  For example,`${data.github}` is populated with the Engineer's github username

The actual HTML page is then generated by using `fs.writeFile`. You can see the sample HTML page created in the `dist` folder of this repository. 

Using the `fs.appendFile` method, a card if generated for each team member when the app is run and these cards append to the body of the HTML page. 

## Final Product
The generated HTML file should contain the following:

    - Navbar with team name
    - Generates a card for each team member with their name, their role and id
    - Manager should also have an office number
    - Engineer should have a github username
    - Intern should also a school name
